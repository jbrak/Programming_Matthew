# Fix this piece of code:
fav = input("What is your favorite integer? ")
favSquared = int(fav) ** 2
print("Your favourite number squared is:", favSquared)

# Re-write the code above so that it does the same for a float:
fav = input("What is your favorite float? ")
favSquared = float(fav) ** 2
print("Your favourite number squared is:", favSquared)
