# Define a variable called num1 that saves the result of an integer input from the user
num1 = int(input("enter a number: "))

# Cube num1 and then add 2 to it, save this new number to a variable called num2.
num2 = (num1**3)+2

# Print the sentence: ________ cubed +2 is ******. Replace ________ with the value of num1 and replace ****** with
# the value of num2
# Eg if my number was 2 the following sentence would be outputted: 2 cubed and +2 is 10
print(num1, "cubed +2 is", num2)
